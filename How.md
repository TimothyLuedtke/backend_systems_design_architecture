### Research

#### Setting Requirements

- Identify the primary purpose and scope of the system
- Undestand the needs and expectations of the end-users of the system.
- Determine the functionality that the system needs to provide to meet the end-users' needs.
- Specify the performance levels that the system needs to achieve.
- Identify any constraints or limitations, such as budget, resources, or time.
- Consider the scalability needs of the system - how it can grow and adapt to increased demand.
- Determine any security requirements to protect data and processes within the system.
- Identify any regulatory or compliance requirements that the system needs to meet.
- Specify the requirements for integrating the new system with existing systems.

#### Exploration

- Research and testing of new technologies.
- Experimenting with new methodologies and tools.
- **Determine if the goal is to improve the system design entirely (innovation) or make small changes where needed (iteration).**

#### Technical Documents

- Used for understanding possible explored solutions or ideas which keep the project on path.
- Provide detailed descriptions of the explored systems, including architectures, modules, interfaces, and data relevant to the project.
- Reference for the development team and other stakeholders.
- Facilitate communicaton and collaboration.

## Implementing System Designs

1. **Choose the Appropriate Design**: Choose the system design that best fits the project requirements, team expertise, budget, and time constraints outlined in technical documents mentioned.

2. **Define the Architecture**: Document the system;s architecture, including its modules, interfaces, and data.

3. **Develop the Architecture**: Begin the development process, ensuring that each component of the architecture is working on its specific task.

4. **Test the Architecture**: Conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues and to ensure that the architecture meets the project requirements.

5. **Deploy the Architecture**:Once the architecture passes all tests, deploy it in a controllable production environment.

6. **Maintain the Architecture**: Regularly update and maintain the architecture to ensure that its ongoing effectiveness and to accomodate any changes in project requrements or business needs.

## Best Practices

- Involve all stakeholders from the beginning to ensure their needs and expectations are met. **[*During Research Phase*](#research)

- User a modular approach to keep the system manageable and understandable.

- Plan for scalability from the beginning to prepare for future growth.

- Design systems to be robust and flexible to handle errors or unexpected inputs and accommmodate changes.

- Consider security needs throughout the design and development process. ***Include SecOps*

- Keep up with the latest technology trends to make informed design decisions.

- Incorporate feedback from users to imrove the system design.
