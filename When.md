## Understanding

- **New Projects**: When starting a *new project*, as "greenfield" scenarios allow for a structured approach from the beginning.

- **Existing Systems**: When scaling an *existing system*, system designs can be used to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

- **Complex Problems**: When there are *complex problems* that need to be broken down into manageable parts.

- **Improved Efficiency and Productivity**: When there is a need for *improved efficiency and productivity*, system designs help in reducing redundancy and facilitating code reuse.

- **Better Communication**: When there is a need for *better communication* among team members, system designs provide a common language and reference.

## Factoring

- **Project Requirements** The functionality, performance, security, and scalability needs of the project.

- **Team Expertise** The experience and skill set of the development team can influence the choice of system design.

- **Budget** Certain designs may require more resources, affecting the cost of the project.

- **Time Constraints** Some designs may take longer to implement than others.

- **Project Size and Complexity** Larger and more complex projects may benefit from certain system designs.

## Considering

- **Maintenance** The ease of maintaining and updating the system can influence the choice of design.

- **Technology Stack** Keeping track of the latest technological trends can influence the choice of system design.

- **User Feedback** Incorporating feedback from users can help improve the system design.

- **Market Trends** Understanding the demands and trends of the market can also affect the choice of system design.

- **Legal and Regulatory Requirements** Compliance with laws and regulations may dictate certain aspects of the system design.
